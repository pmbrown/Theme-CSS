# Theme-CSS

A basic startup document for theme design containing styles for element-specific HTML and optional utility components common in website design. The majority of the styles are written with the following conditions in common:

- Everything is written using :where() for 0 specificity.
- REM units used for sizing values throughout.
- Logical properties are used for directional styles.
- Common property values use CSS variables where practical.
- Color variables are all provided as clean HSL values.

Two scripts are included, one for a manual color-scheme theme-switch button and the other for opening the dialog modal styles included.
