# Theme-CSS.

## Startup styles, variables and utilities for website theme design.

Contains basic startup styles for element-specific HTML, a simple color palette with light and dark mode color-schemes, and optional utility extensions common in website design. The majority of the styles have the following in common:

- Written with ```:where()``` for 0 specificity.
- REM units are used for sizing values.
- Directional styles use logical properties.
- Properties and values use variables where practical.

The repository includes the standard and minified CSS and JS (for theme switch and dialog modals), and the Sass source files for recompiling the styles.
